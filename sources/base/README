ADAKTA ADK Yocto BSP
===============================

Quick Start Guide
-----------------

Once you have downloaded the source of all projects, you will have to
call:

$: MACHINE=adakta-adk DISTRO=fslc-x11 source setup-environment build/

Then create your own distro or compile a demo
core-image-minimal
core-image-sato
core-image-x11

For example
$: bitbake core-image-minimal

We strongly recommend that you study Yocto and create your own image.
